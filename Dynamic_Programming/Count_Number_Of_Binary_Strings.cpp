/*
You are provided an integers N. You need to count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1â€™s.

Input Format
First line contains integer t which is number of test case. For each test case, it contains an integer n which is the the length of Binary String.

Constraints
1<=t<=100 1<=n<=90

Output Format
Print the number of all possible binary strings.

Sample Input
2
